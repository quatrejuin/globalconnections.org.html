						<img src="../images/About/MaP_Peking1.jpg" align="right" />
                        
                        <p>My name is Jiang Xueqin, and I am director of the Peking University High School International Division in Beijing, China.  In July 2011 the Global Connections community was kind enough to invite me to visit South Africa and Botswana with three dozen of the world's most passionate educators.  The trip exposed me to the beauty of southern Africa and the warmth of its people, and permitted me to see the education possibilities and power of cross-cultural communication.  During the trip, I quickly reached a student exchange agreement with Andy Taylor, Global Connections stalwart and the headmaster of Maru-a-Pula (MaP), which had hosted us in Gaberone. </p>

<p>This February we sent fifteen students and two teachers to MaP for cross-cultural learning and service learning.  MaP students' love of learning and passion for life amazed our students, and the MaP community welcomed our students with open arms from the first day.  In the service learning projects, while at first our students were afraid to interact with disabled children and AIDS orphans, they learned to overcome their fears and <br />prejudices, and to open their hearts and minds.  </p>
<img src="../images/About/MaP_Peking2.jpg" align="right" />
<p>After the trip, we conducted an assessment of the educational impact of the trip.  All fifteen students felt that service learning was the most valuable component of the trip, that helping others made them feel happy and fulfilled, and that they would like to continue service learning in China.  We felt that the students had matured a great deal, and were eloquent when discussing the intellectual significance of the trip.  In the classroom, we teachers have noticed that the students who went on the Botswana trip had become more curious, more motivated, and more creative.  </p>

<p>The MaP community has inspired us to develop an intensive service learning program.  We are planning a one-week trip in June to teach rural children in Guangxi, China.  We also want to increase our students' geo-political awareness; we are currently devising a one-week trip to visit Israel to learn about their entrepreneurial culture, their prestigious engineering schools and research centers, the Holocaust, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  </p>

<p>We at Peking University High School International Division have benefited greatly from our relationship with Global Connections.  Besides Maru-a-Pula we also have a close relationship with Hotchkiss, which our students visit every summer to study literature and theater for three weeks.  We hope to establish more student exchange programs with Global Connections schools soon.  This July our headmaster Wang Zheng and his deputy Donald Holder will attend Global Connections in New Zealand to further develop Peking University High School's global network. </p>   

<p>Our students' visit to Maru-a-Pula has transformed their lives, and forever changed the way they see themselves and the world.  This would not have been possible without the Global Connections community, and we hope by sharing our story we'll encourage others to share their stories as well.
